    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasources:\n",
    "- Main website link: https://www.airbnb.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the code developed for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree [nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/courses/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). It's written in **Python Jupyter Notebooks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code focuses on data cleaning and a simple linear model for prediction of the number of reviews (that we will consider a representation of the number of sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical prediction is limited by the available features as well as by the employment of Ordinary Least Square Multiple Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome is anyway of some interest as, in its simplicity, it is able to predict the data variability up to R2 = 0.57 and shows which features have statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sicily, Airbnb publishes 51,000+ listings. The vast majority is for entire homes or apartments, the rest is for private rooms. Some top level analysis can be found here: http://insideairbnb.com/sicily\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sicilian coast line is densily populated, as well as some internal areas, especially during the summer period. It is quite common to own a holiday house. During the past few years, pushed by increasing taxes on property, economic depression and the increased availability of listing platforms on the internet (see Booking.com, Airbnb.com, etc) it is more and more common to rent those properties as a form of secondary income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering Sicily is a big tourism attraction (more than 2 millions bookings in 2021, https://www.guidasicilia.it/notizia/nel-2021-la-sicilia-ha-trainato-il-turismo-italiano/3014341) it is clear there are a large number of hosts for whom tourist is the main form of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- http://insideairbnb.com/sicily\n",
    "- http://data.insideairbnb.com/italy/sicilia/sicily/2022-03-29/data/listings.csv.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are those freely made available on the InsideAirbnb website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The provided datasets have lot of missing values and some other which are difficult to interpret or use.\n",
    "Most of the efforts of this notebook are on pre-processing.\n",
    "    - Replace NaNs with known values (zeros or means)\n",
    "    - Clean various features\n",
    "    - Identify key features for the prediction\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will not consider any geographical feature (such as neighborhood or latitude/longitude) as it would have required additional effort to reduce the neighborhood number of variables based on geographical or administrative categorization (area, county etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To replicate the findings and execute the code in this repository you will need\n",
    "basically the next Python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "- [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)\n",
